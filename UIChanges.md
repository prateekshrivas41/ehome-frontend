## Roofing Form – Tabbed Form Component Integration
### Summary
This update introduces a new FormTabs component to streamline the form step navigation within the roofing form flow. The form steps remain logically the same, but have been refactored to be more flexible and user-friendly through a tab-based UI structure.

### *What's New*

- FormTabs Component Added
A reusable component that allows steps in the roofing form to be grouped and presented as tabs.

- Improved Step Flow
Steps are now grouped more intelligently — e.g., showing two steps in a single view where appropriate — to enhance the user experience without altering the overall process logic.

- No Change to Form Logic
While the implementation now uses tab-based navigation, the underlying form steps and data handling remain unchanged.
